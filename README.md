# recipe-classifier
Final project for CS63 Artificial Intelligence, with partner. We trained a neural network to classify recipes by type of cuisine (Indian, French, etc.) based on their ingredients.

Before running, activate the virtual Keras environment using ource /usr/swat/bin/CS63env.

To execute the program, ssh into a computer with a good GPU such as anise and type in python3 sort_foods.py into the command line.

It will generate an output file, out.csv.

This is the submission file to kaggle. Recreate the file every time you run the code.

The data comes from two json files: test.json and train.json. 

You can also look at our previous output files, which show our success rates
with using part of the training set as a validation set. 

output_with_summary.txt is one example.
